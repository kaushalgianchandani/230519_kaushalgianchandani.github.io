<p>Hi again! It seems that you have decided to click on the blog section on my homepage (although I am not quite sure why would you do that!) and I thank you for that. As you could probably tell from the introductory line, this is going to be a pretty informal one-way interaction between us, unless of course you decide on writing back to me which would be highly appreciated. <br> I have always been somewhat attached to the idea of having a blog and this is the 4th attempt to realize that idea. `Summation' seems like an arbitrary choice for the name of a blog. The reason why I chose this name is pretty un-ornamented. In 2015, I was looking for an internship for the coming summer when I encountered Dr. Chew Lock Yue's homepage where he mentions the quote 'the whole is more than the sum of its parts'. The quote has stuck with me ever since. This blog is an attempt to present to you the said sum</p>
