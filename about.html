{{site.author_blurb}}

Hi there! Thank you for your interest in my webpage. I am an aspiring physicist, currently a part of the 5 years
integrated M.Sc. program at the [National Institute of Science Education and Reserach][niser], Bhubaneswar. I am interested
in anything and everything which concerns with physics, but throughout my undergraduate years, I've devoted much of
my time to nonlinear dynamics and its manifestation in various physical phenomena. Most recently I've dived into
geophysical fluid dynamics and am working on baroclinic instablity for my master's thesis. For more information, you can
take a look at my [curriculum vitae][cv].
