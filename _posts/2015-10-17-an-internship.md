This is my fist blog after the test blog of course. And what better subject to write on at this time of the year. Being a science major this is the time when I'm looking for internships. Having done 4 of them, I thought it might be a good idea to share my experiences. Please note that if you're looking for an answer to the question: 'What should I do?', you're at the wrong place, however, it might be helpful to read it like a story.

This is the first thing which one has to make his or her mind about. NOT TO ASK ANYONE WHAT TO DO. It may sound a bit weird in the beginning but I believe that internships should be about what you want to do, what you want to explore, where you want to go. It should be about YOU. One of my college Professors, <a href="http://www.niser.ac.in/~bedanga/" target="blank">Prof. Bedangadas Mohanty</a> once gave us, what I believe, is some very good advice about how to seek an internship. According to him you can do one or more of the following four things:
1. Do something related to the course work of the next semester.
2. Talk to your teachers and ask them what to do.
3. Speak to your seniors and try to learn from their experience.
4. Look on the internet, find out about the work of different people and then decide what you want to do.

Well as I've mentioned I'm not in complete agreement of the second point but I believe that the rest is absolutely sound advice. In this blog I want to focus particularly on the last point. The internet is a resource available at our disposal all the time. If used wisely it can help you find your desired internship with a lot of ease. What happens many a times to people is that they get lost on the web and end up giving upon the idea. This has happened to me as well. Based on my agreeably finite experience, I think what I'm going to tell you might help you deal with this problem.

There are broadly two ways in which you can secure an internship, (a) you can apply via various programs like the the <a href="http://iusstf.org/story/53-74-For-Indian-Students.html" target="blank">S.N. Bose Scholars Program</a>, <a href = "https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship" target="blank">Mitacs</a>, the <a href = "http://www.hri.res.in/academics/physics/phy-vsp/" target="blank">Visiting Students program</a> at HRI, Allahbad etc. Please note that these are only a few programs that I've mentioned. There are tonnes of other programs like the ones conducted by IMSc Chennai, ICTS Bangalore and the detailed information about these programs can be found out on their respective websites.
