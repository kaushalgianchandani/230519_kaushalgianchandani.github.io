This is my fist blog after the test blog of course. And what better subject to write on at this time of the year. Being a science major this is the time when I'm looking for internships. Having done 4 of them, I thought it might be a good idea to share my experiences. Please note that if you're looking for an answer to the question: 'What should I do?', you're at the wrong place, however, it might be helpful to read it like a story.

This is the first thing which one has to make his or her mind about. NOT TO ASK ANYONE WHAT TO DO. It may sound a bit weird in the beginning but I believe that internships should be about what you want to do, what you want to explore, where you want to go. It should be about YOU. One of my college Professors, <a href="http://www.niser.ac.in/~bedanga/" target="blank">Prof. Bedangadas Mohanty</a> once gave us, what I believe, is some very good advice about how to seek an internship.
