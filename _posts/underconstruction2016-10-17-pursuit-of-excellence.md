<p align="left"> I receive a phone call at 07:30 in the morning from my mother. She's carrying out her usual ritual of waking me up every morning to attend a class at 08:30. I tell her still half asleep say to her "Maa today is Holi! Happy Holi!" To which her reply was, "I know beta. Happy Holi to you too. But I assumed that like every other holiday, you must have some or the other class." I could sense a little bit of irony in her voice and the sadness of missing her son on every holiday that mattered in a typical Hindu household. I let it slide because I truly believe that here at RISER, we the students are considered to be national assets and are being trained with the aim of embedding scientific rigor within larger pedagogic practices in our country </p>

<p align="left"> Regional Institute of Science Education and Research (RISER) is an institute under the National Atomic Energy Foundation (NAEF). It is a popular belief, atleast inside RISER, that it is one of the best institutes in the country if not across the world and the tailor made curriculum is designed to make students at all levels - bachelor's, master's and doctoral candidates thrive in research.</p>

<p align="left"> I get up from my bed and go to the bathroom, to find that there is no water in the taps. I am not at all annoyed as this is a part of my routine. I don't bother trying harder as I know the efforts would be vain. I come back to my room and sit down, trying to control my urge to poop, it isn't very difficult because I didn't eat any food last night - I was scared of being having food poisoning again. I didn't want to go through the agony for the 3rd time in three weeks.</p>

<p align="left">My hands instinctively go to my laptop, opening the email, looking if I have received any acceptances or rejections</p>
